# THE HEALING PATH FROM ADDICTION: HEALER'S GUIDE

**A Training Manual for Indigenous Healers, Social Workers, and Counselors**

---

## Your Role as Healer

### Opening Statement to Yourself

You are about to guide someone on the hardest journey they will ever walk. You cannot walk it for them. You cannot want their healing more than they want it. You can only witness, teach, and hold the boundary.

This guide prepares you to deliver the Seven Sacred Teachings framework for addiction healing. You will learn:
- How to recognize which traps someone is caught in
- When to be blunt and when to be gentle
- How to hold boundaries when they test you
- How to complete your own healing while guiding others

**Critical truth:** You cannot guide others effectively if you have never overcome the direct or indirect impacts of the effects of addictions yourself. Chaos cannot teach order. Trapped people cannot teach freedom. If you've never been affected by addictions, advise the seeker you are a helper and that the seeker that this system is too important to ignore, and they must keep an open mind. Be honest. They'll know when you are lying.

Before you begin working with others, ask yourself honestly:
- Am I sober today, or am I managing my own active addiction?
- Are my children safe, or am I in crisis myself?
- Do my actions match my words?
- Can I hold firm boundaries when someone manipulates or threatens?

If you answered no to any of these, **complete your own healing first.** Use the companion teaching document for yourself. Return to guiding others when you are walking in balance.

## Understanding the Framework

### The Ancestral Teaching: Phantom vs. Real Problems

**Core principle:** "Do not preoccupy yourself with problems that don't exist in the real."

**What this means:**
- **Real problems:** Exist right now, in this moment. Can be acted upon today.
- **Phantom problems:** Exist only in the mind. Worries about future that hasn't happened, or past that cannot be changed.

**Your job as healer:** Help them distinguish between the two.

**Examples:**

**Real problem:** "I am hungover today and my children need to eat."
**Phantom problem:** "What if I relapse next week? What will people think of me?"

**Real problem:** "My partner is violent when they drink."
**Phantom problem:** "What if I can't survive without them? What if I'm alone forever?"

**Real problem:** "I used yesterday and need to get back up today."
**Phantom problem:** "I'm a failure. I'll always be broken. Why even try?"

**Teaching approach:** When they bring phantom problems, gently redirect:
- "That worry is about tomorrow. What is the real problem today that needs your attention?"
- "The past already happened. What choice do you control right now, in this moment?"

**Do not dismiss their fears.** Acknowledge them, then redirect to what they can actually act on today.

## The Seven Sacred Teachings: Your Teaching Approach

### Framework Overview

The Seven Sacred Teachings provide the foundation for all healing work. Each teaching addresses a specific aspect of the journey from addiction to balance.

**Your role:** Help them see how each teaching applies to their daily life, not just as abstract concepts.

### 1. LOVE (Zaagi'idiwin) - Breaking the Cycle

**Traditional meaning:** Unconditional care for all our relations.

**Practical application for addiction healing:**
- Love yourself = stop harming yourself
- Love your children = break the cycle they're inheriting
- Love is action, not just feeling

**How to teach this:**
- Point to their children: "Every time you choose sobriety today, that is love in action for them."
- Reframe self-care: "Staying sober is not selfish. It's the most loving thing you can do for your family."
- Seven generations: "Your choice today protects your great-great-grandchildren from this trap."

**When they resist:** "I'm a bad parent, I've already damaged them."
**Your response:** "The past is real. Today is also real. Show them the warrior who gets back up. That's the teaching they need."

### 2. RESPECT (Manaaji'idiwin) - Choosing Your Circle

**Traditional meaning:** Honor all creation, treat others and yourself with dignity.

**Practical application:**
- Respect yourself = refuse to follow people whose lives are falling apart
- Respect ancestors = don't waste the life they fought to give you
- Respect your healer = be honest, even when shame says hide

**How to teach this:**
- Be blunt: "Do not take sobriety advice from someone who is drunk."
- Help them audit their circle: "Who are you listening to? Are they living well?"
- Set expectation of honesty: "I need you to tell me when you fail. Hiding it keeps you trapped."

**When they resist:** "But that's my family/best friend/partner."
**Your response:** "You can love someone from a distance. Your children's safety comes first."

### 3. COURAGE (Aakode'ewin) - Getting Back Up

**Traditional meaning:** Face your fears, do what is right even when it is hard.

**Practical application:**
- Courage = seeing the trap and choosing not to enter
- Courage = getting back up after falling
- Courage = saying "I need help" when pride says handle it alone

**How to teach this:**
- Normalize failure: "You will fail. That's part of learning."
- Reframe asking for help: "Asking for help is warrior strength, not weakness."
- Celebrate small wins: "You stayed sober today when you wanted to use. That's courage."

**When they resist:** "I keep failing, I'm not strong enough."
**Your response:** "The crow teaching applies. You tried one way, it didn't work. Try a different way. Failure is information, not identity."

### 4. HONESTY (Gwayakwaadiziwin) - Seeing Real vs. Phantom

**Traditional meaning:** Speak and live truth, keep integrity in all things.

**Practical application:**
- Be honest about what's REAL vs. what you're imagining
- Be honest when you fail
- The first lie you must stop telling is the lie you tell yourself

**How to teach this:**
- Practice daily question: "What is the REAL problem today?"
- Catch phantom worries: "That's a 'what if' worry. What is real, right now?"
- Model honesty yourself: "I failed three times last month. Here's what I learned."

**When they resist:** Lying, hiding relapses, making excuses.
**Your response:** "I cannot help you if you hide. Honesty is the first step. The trap wants you to hide in shame."

### 5. WISDOM (Nibwaakaawin) - Pattern Recognition

**Traditional meaning:** Cherish knowledge and use it well for the good of all.

**Practical application:**
- Learn from the crow (fail, adapt, try again)
- See patterns: "Every time I'm around this person, I fall"
- Know the difference between real problems and phantom worries

**How to teach this:**
- Help them identify patterns: "What happened the last three times you relapsed? What's the pattern?"
- Teach trap recognition: "Which people/places/situations are traps for you?"
- Use their failures as teaching: "What did you learn from falling yesterday?"

**When they resist:** "It just happened, there's no pattern."
**Your response:** "Let's look closer. Walk me through the day before you used. What was happening?"

### 6. HUMILITY (Dabaadendiziwin) - Accepting Help

**Traditional meaning:** Know your place in creation, neither above nor below others.

**Practical application:**
- Accept both truths: "I need guidance" AND "only I can walk my path"
- Admit failure without drowning in shame
- Ask for help

**How to teach this:**
- Set the partnership: "I guide. You walk. Both are necessary."
- When they fail: "Humility admits 'I failed.' Pride drowns in 'I'm a failure.'"
- When they succeed: "Humility says 'I'm walking well today, but the path continues tomorrow.'"

**When they resist:** "I should be able to do this alone" or "I'm completely helpless without you"
**Your response:** "Both are traps. You need guidance. And only you can take each step."

### 7. TRUTH (Debwewin) - Alignment of Words and Actions

**Traditional meaning:** Live authentically, align your actions with your deepest values.

**Practical application:**
- You have power in this moment, right now
- The past doesn't control the present unless you give it that power
- Your children are watching—what truth are you showing them?

**How to teach this:**
- Daily alignment check: "Did your actions today match what you said you would do?"
- Power in the present: "You control this moment. This breath. This choice."
- Children as witnesses: "What are you teaching them with your life, not your words?"

**When they resist:** "I have no power, I'm controlled by my addiction/past/circumstances"
**Your response:** "That's a lie the trap tells you. You chose to come here today. That was power."

## Recognizing the Traps

### Your Job: Teach Trap Recognition

The person you're guiding cannot avoid traps they cannot see. Your job is to help them recognize patterns.

### Common Traps to Help Them Identify:

**1. Substances (obvious trap)**
- Alcohol, drugs promise relief, deliver chains that are traps
- First time helps forget, hundredth time owns you

**2. Toxic relationships**
- Feel like connection, drain life force
- Pull them back to chaos
- Intensity mistaken for intimacy

**3. Social Assistance without growth**
- Survival without living
- Comfort becomes the trap
- No forward movement, just existing

**4. Bad guidance from chaotic people**
- Misery loves company
- Drowning people pull others under
- Cannot teach what they haven't learned

**5. People who want them to fail**
- Threatened by their healing
- Bring up past mistakes
- Offer traps disguised as friendship
- Celebrate when they stumble

**6. Old circle pulling them back**
- "You've changed, you're not fun anymore"
- "Just one time won't hurt"
- "You think you're better than us?"
- Testing their resolve, wanting company in misery

**7. Phantom problems (biggest trap)**
- "What if" worries about tomorrow
- Dwelling on unchangeable past
- Imagined future disasters
- Steals power from today's real work

**8. Addiction to the addict (hardest trap - covered in detail below)**

## The Hardest Trap: When Love Becomes Addiction

### Recognizing Codependency Patterns

**This section is CRITICAL.** Many of the healers you train will recognize themselves here. Many of the people they guide will be trapped in this pattern.

**Signs someone is addicted to a person, not just substances:**
- Believe their staying will save the other person
- Feel responsible for the other person's survival
- Identity has become "the one who helps them"
- Mistake chaos for connection
- Leaving feels impossible, even when staying means mutual destruction

**This is as real as substance addiction.** Same patterns:
- Obsessive thinking about the person
- Loss of boundaries
- Continuing despite harm
- Failed attempts to leave
- Returning despite knowing the damage

### Two Scenarios to Address:

**Scenario 1: They have somewhere to go but can't bring themselves to leave**

This is addiction to the addict. Treat it like substance addiction:
- Recognize the trap
- Seek help
- Walk away

**What to tell them:**
"Tell them once: 'I love you. When you are ready to walk the healing path, I will walk beside you. But I cannot stay in the trap with you.' Then go. Guilt will pull at you. Violence may escalate. Promises will be made. Do not return."

**Scenario 2: They literally have nowhere to go (survival dependency)**

This is different. This is crisis.

**Immediate resources to provide:**
- Women's shelter contact
- Men's crisis line
- Indigenous friendship centre
- Provincial social services
- Your direct support for safety planning

**While they're trapped:**
- Make safety plan which is the most critical
- Save money if possible and find a well trusted safe person to hold it for them
- Document violence if safe to do so
- Maintain whatever sobriety they can
- Keep planning escape
- The moment a path opens, take it

**Critical warning to give them:**
"If a family member or friend takes you in, DO NOT burn that bridge. That escape route may be the only one you will ever get."

### The Teaching That Applies to Both:

"You cannot save someone who is drowning while they pull you under. You will both drown."

"Love does not require you to drown. Love does not require you to sacrifice your children."

"Sometimes the most loving thing you can do is refuse to participate in someone else's destruction."

"Your sobriety might eventually show them the path is possible—but only if you survive."

**"You cannot set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm."**

---

## When the Old Circle Pulls Them Back

### What Will Happen

Their previous circle—enablers, drinking buddies, addicts who wanted company—will notice they're different. They will feel threatened. They will test them.

**They will say:**
- "You've changed. You're not fun anymore."
- "Come on, just one time for old times' sake. It won't hurt."
- "You think you're better than us now?"
- "Remember the good times? Let's do it again."
- "You're being dramatic. You didn't have a real problem."
- "What? You think your shit don't stink?"

### Teach Them the Response

**Truth, spoken once, with no debate:**

"I'm walking a different path now. I care about you, but I can't walk with you anymore. I wish you well."

Then walk away. No arguing. No explaining. No defending. No trying to convince them to change.

### Why No Debate?

**Teach them this:**

"They are not asking a question—they are testing your resolve. They want company in their misery. Your sobriety makes them uncomfortable about their own choices. Your strength reminds them of their weakness. They will keep testing until you prove the boundary is real."

**Say it once. Walk away. If they contact again with the same invitation, silence is also an answer.**

### If They're Family and Complete Separation Isn't Possible:

"I love you, but I cannot be around drinking/drugs. When you're ready to talk about something else, I'm here."

Then leave or end the conversation the moment substances appear.

**This is not cruelty. This is protection. They are building a fortress. The old circle is trying to open the gate. Their job is to keep it closed.**

---

## The Crow Teaching: Fail and Adapt

### How to Teach This

**Set the expectation upfront:** "You are going to fail. Accept this now."

**Normalize failure:**
- "You will make mistakes"
- "You will fall down"
- "You will choose wrong sometimes"
- "You will walk into a trap even though you saw it coming"
- "This is part of being human. This is part of learning."

### The Crow Metaphor

**Tell them this story:**

"Watch a crow trying to crack open a nut. The crow tries pecking. Doesn't work. Does the crow sit there and starve? Does the crow shame itself and say 'I'm a terrible crow, I should just give up'?

No. The crow tries a different way. Drops it from a height. Puts it on a road for a car to run over. Finds a rock to crack it against.

The crow adapts. The crow learns. The crow persists.

**You are the crow.**"

### Reframing Failure

**When they fail, teach them:**

"That is information. That is teaching. The failure says: 'That way did not work. Try a different way.' The failure does NOT say: 'You are worthless. Quit. You will never succeed.'"

**Critical distinction:**

"'I failed' is truth. 'I failed so I quit trying' is excuse."

### Your Response When They Fail

**Do not shame them. Ask them:**
- "What can you learn from this?"
- "What should you do differently next time?"
- "Then get back up and walk."

**Model this yourself:** "I failed three times this month. Here's what the crow learned from each one."

---

## Holding Boundaries: When They Test You

### Recognize the Tests

**They will test you. This is normal. This is part of the process.**

**Common tests:**
- Lying about relapses
- Making excuses
- Blaming others
- "You don't understand"
- "It's different for me"
- Manipulation ("If you cared, you'd...")
- Threats to quit coming
- Anger when you're honest

### How to Hold the Boundary

**Stay calm. Stay firm. Stay compassionate.**

**Example responses:**

**When they lie:**
"I cannot help you if you hide from me. The trap wants you to hide in shame. I'm here when you're ready to be honest."

**When they make excuses:**
"I hear you. And what is the real problem today that you can actually act on?"

**When they blame others:**
"You cannot control what they did. What choice do you control right now?"

**When they say "you don't understand":**
"You're right, I don't know exactly what you're experiencing. But I know traps. And I see this one. Let's talk about what you can do today."

**When they manipulate:**
"That's not how this works. I guide. You walk. I cannot want your healing more than you want it."

**When they threaten to quit:**
"That's your choice. I'm here if you come back. But I will not chase you or beg you. This path requires you to choose it."

### What You Cannot Do

**Remember and remind them:**
- I cannot walk the path for you
- I cannot make your choices for you
- I cannot remove consequences of your actions
- I cannot fix you (you are not broken—you are learning and healing)
- I cannot want sobriety for you more than you want it for yourself

---

## Daily Practice Framework

### Teach Them the Daily Questions

**Every day, they should ask themselves:**

1. What is the REAL problem today? (Not imagined future problems)
2. What trap am I seeing right now?
3. Am I choosing to avoid it, or am I walking toward it?
4. Did I fail today? What did the crow learn from this?
5. Who am I listening to? Are they living well?
6. What am I building today—strength or excuses?

### Your Check-Ins

**When you check in with them, ask these questions.**

**Be honest in your assessment of their answers.**

If they say "I walked into the trap today," that honesty is the beginning of getting back up. Acknowledge it. Don't shame it. Ask what they learned.

### Daily Connection to Spirit

**Teach them:**

"Daily connection to Spirit and Creator through whatever practice fits you: prayer, meditation, smudging, time in nature, talking to your ancestors. This is not magic. This is grounding. This is remembering you are not alone."

**The Creator and ancestors provide strength, but they do not provide shortcuts. You still must walk. They walk with you, but they do not carry you.**

---

## Building the Fortress Metaphor

### How to Teach This

**Use this visualization:**

"Imagine you are building a fortress to protect your children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Every choice you make is either a stone in that wall or a crack in the foundation."

**Help them see their daily choices as building materials:**
- Each day sober = stone in the wall
- Each trap avoided = gate growing stronger
- Each time getting back up = foundation going deeper
- Each wise choice about who to listen to = watchtower to see danger coming

**Inside the fortress:** Children safe. Grandchildren growing strong. Seven generations protected.

**Outside the fortress:** Traps waiting. Chaos. Destruction. The same cycles that crushed their ancestors.

### The Generational Frame

**Remind them:**

"Your ancestors began building this fortress for you. They survived residential schools. They survived the Sixties Scoop. They survived starvation, genocide, disease, violence, walked hundreds of miles with nothing in their stomachs and their children strapped to their backs, they were hunted, for too many didn't survive, many agents used alcohol to get chiefs to sign away the rights and land of the people, theft of everything they had. They built a foundation with their survival.

Now it's your turn. You build on what they started. You make the walls higher and stronger. You build so well that your great-great-grandchildren will live inside these walls and be safe from what tried to destroy you."

### The Daily Assessment

**Teach them to ask every evening:**
- Did I build today, or did I make excuses?
- Did I protect the fortress, or did I open the gate to let traps in?
- Did I show my children a warrior, or did I show them a victim?

## Your Own Healing While Guiding Others

### Critical Truth for Lived-Experience Healers

**If you are a healer who has lived through addiction, prison, toxic relationships—you bring unique power to this work. But you must be honest with yourself.**

**You may still be in transition to heal yourself.**

**That's acceptable. That's even beneficial. But you must:**
1. Be honest about where you are on the path
2. Continue your own healing while guiding others
3. Use your struggles as teaching, not as shame

### When You Recognize Yourself in the Teaching

**Session 2 will likely be your breakthrough moment.**

When you teach about "addiction to the addict" and recognize yourself—that's when YOUR healing completes.

**This is normal. This is part of the process.**

**Allow the emotion. Process it. Then use it.**

When you sit with someone in crisis and they say "I keep failing," you can respond with truth:

"I failed three times this month. Crow teaching—get back up. Here's what I learned."

"I just cut off my toxic sister last week. It hurt like hell. But my kids come first. Here's how I did it."

"Some days I still want to use. That's real. And I choose not to, THIS day, THIS moment. Tomorrow I'll choose again."

### This Is Peer-to-Peer Healing

**Not expert-to-patient. Not recovered-to-broken.**

**Warrior-to-warrior. Both building fortresses. Both teaching your children. Both walking the path together.**

---

## When to Refer Out

### Recognize Your Limits

**You are a healer, not a crisis intervention specialist.**

**Refer immediately when:**
- Active suicidal ideation with plan
- Active homicidal ideation
- Severe mental health crisis (psychosis, mania, severe depression requiring medical intervention)
- Medical detox needed (severe withdrawal symptoms)
- Domestic violence requiring immediate safety intervention

**Referral resources to have ready:**
- Crisis lines (suicide prevention, mental health crisis)
- Women's shelters, men's crisis lines
- Hospital emergency departments
- Detox facilities
- Provincial social services
- Police (in cases of immediate danger)

**You can still walk beside them while they receive crisis intervention. But recognize when medical/legal professionals need to be involved.**

---

## Cultural Practices and Ceremonies

### Integration with Traditional Ways

**When available and appropriate:**
- Smudging for clarity
- Sweat lodge for purification
- Pipe ceremony for connection to Spirit
- Drumming for grounding
- Talking circles for community support

**Important reminder to give them:**

"These are tools the ancestors gave us. They are not magic fixes—you still must choose and act—but they provide strength."

**For women's healing circles:**
Honor the sacred responsibility as life-givers and protectors of children. Strength in nurturing is also strength in fierce protection of family. Break cycles of violence and exploitation.

**For men's healing circles:**
Honor the role as providers and protectors. Model strength for your sons. Warrior spirit means protecting, not destroying. Break cycles of absent fathers and violence.

---

## Signs of Progress

### What to Look For

**Early signs (first 2-4 weeks):**
- Showing up consistently
- Increased honesty about struggles
- Recognizing traps before walking into them (even if they still walk in)
- Asking for help instead of hiding
- Small behavioral changes (showing up sober, keeping commitments)

**Medium-term signs (1-3 months):**
- Actually avoiding some traps they used to walk into
- Getting back up faster after falling
- Starting to audit their circle
- Setting boundaries with toxic people
- Daily practice becoming routine
- Phantom vs. real distinction becoming automatic

**Long-term signs (3-6+ months):**
- Consistent sobriety
- Healthy circle established
- Children noticeably safer/more stable
- Helping others who are struggling
- Living the Seven Teachings without constant reminder
- Building the fortress daily

### Warning Signs of Regression

**Watch for:**
- Increasing dishonesty or hiding
- Stopping communication suddenly
- Making excuses for old circle contact
- Phantom problem focus increasing
- Missed sessions without explanation
- Defensive reactions to gentle questions
- "I've got this handled" overconfidence

**When you see these, address directly:**

"I notice you've missed our last two sessions. What's happening? What trap am I not seeing?"

---

## Measuring Success

### Short-Term Metrics (Your responsibility)

**Track for each person you guide:**
- Session attendance
- Self-reported sobriety days
- Trap recognition frequency
- Number of times they got back up after falling
- Progress on daily questions practice

### Long-Term Metrics (Community level)

**What the community should see over time:**
- Family reunifications
- Children staying home (not in foster care)
- Reduction in crisis interventions
- More people achieving sustained sobriety
- Next generation showing trap-awareness

**This is generational work. Immediate results matter, but seven-generations outcomes matter more.**

---

## Final Reminders

### The Teaching Is Complete. The Delivery Is the Variable.

**These frameworks work ONLY if delivered with unflinching honesty.**

The bluntness IS the medicine. Compassion without truth is enablement.

**Do not soften:**
- "Do not take life advice from people whose lives are falling apart"
- "You cannot set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm"
- "Chaos cannot teach order"
- "The first lie you must stop telling is the lie you tell yourself"

**These statements will make people uncomfortable. That discomfort is the trap being exposed.**

### Your Work Is Sacred

**You are not just teaching sobriety. You are:**
- Breaking intergenerational trauma cycles
- Building fortresses that protect seven generations
- Teaching children trap-awareness they'll pass to their children
- Restoring warrior spirit to communities that forgot their strength

**This is Light Warrior work.**

Walk in balance. Teach with honesty. Hold the boundary with compassion.

**The people need you strong.**
